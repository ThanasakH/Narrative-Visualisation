# Narrative Visualisation Report

## Implementation
In order to make an accessible visualisation, developing a website might be a perfect solution at the moment. Hence, we have decided to develop them on the R studio and selected some libraries to advocate our project.

First, the Shiny library will support all processes of HTML part including bind related elements from front-end to back-end and refresh data from input elements to linked outputs. The main reason we opted it because we would like to reduce the development process and reuse a variety of external libraries. Another important library is dplyr. it will help manipulate all Data Frames. For example, filtering, converting, grouping, and aggregating data. Moreover, the ggplot2 is responsible for drawing a different kind of graphs such as lines graph, and bar chart. Lastly, the Leaflet and rgdal can comfortably create a geo-map, polygon shape, and extra symbols with some interactions.

To align the design from the Five Design Sheet, we are required to explore an additional data which is an Australian GDP each state and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), who provides trusted official statistics for Australia, has gathered and published this desirable data on the internet.

## User guide
There are five main sections which users can explore data as figure 7. The top first area will introduce you to our narrative visualisation and guide some background of Australia and the reason why we decided to investigate this topic.

The second area is an overall Australian migration and GDP. There are two different elements. A bar chart in blue will represent how healthy the economy in Australia is in term of GDP, while a red line shows an Overseas migration population. Moreover, users are able to customise a time on the slide bar to scope down data.

Next area will be a proportional symbol map. It can easily recognise whether in which states have increased or decreased the number of migration population by the coloured arrow symbols. Whereas, the coloured dollar symbols indicate a percentage of GDP. Furthermore, all symbolsâ€™ sizes represent a degree of level on their aspects and once mouse hovers on states, the information in detail will pop up as figure 10. Lastly, users can modify a period of time same as the first visualisation.

Final visualisation, this graph will display a trend and change of Overseas migration in Australia each state. Users can set a period of time on the slide bar and select particularly states to compare with other states.

## Conclusion
To summarise this project, it is potentially a relationship between Overseas migration population and Australian GDP. Since the number of overseas migrations in Australia is gradually growing, especially in New South Wealth and Victoria. Besides the GDP in those two states are relatively higher than others. However, we cannot ignore other factors, for instance, Global GDP, Oil rate, Gold rate, Global crisis, etc.

This project has taught me about how to design and apply a proper visualisation in different situations because there is no fixed solution for all designs and a targeted user is needed to determine clearly at first so that, users will be received a desirable project.
