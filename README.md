# Narrative-Visualisation

## Background
In this project, you are asked to create an interactive narrative visualisation that communicates some of your findings from the Data Exploration Project.

## Introduction
Australia is one of the most liveable countries and there are many people around the world intend to migrate to this country. The purpose of this project is to explore Australian migration data, find a relationship between migration data and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and create an interactive visualisation. A targeted client will be specialised users and general people who understand basic bar chart, line graph, and map. Besides, two main questions below are determined to be guided throughout this project.

**Questions:**
1. Does overseas migration affect an Australia economy?
2. What is the migration population in each state?


## Design
A design of visualisation is aimed to simplify complicated economic data and migration information. Therefore, The Five Design Sheet methodology (FdS) is an appropriate and useful solution in term of forming creative and diverse visualisations.

The first sheet, all ideas and supplement of visualisations are required to brainstorm without logical thinking. For instance, we briefly have a bar chart, line graph, and geo-map to be based visualisations and combine them with supplementary options such as shape, size, color, symbol, dropdown list, checkbox, radio button, and slide bar. As a result, figure 1 shows some combinations of graphs and some supplementary options. After that, only most efficient and proper sets will be selected to the further process, while, the other ideas will be discarded. For example, a density map and a cartogram map have been removed since they are not easy to distinguish information and general users may face problems.

The second sheet, this design consists of geo-map, symbol, color, and size to represent numbers of Australian migration and GDP each state. Furthermore, the green color indicates a positive meaning whereas red color informs negative amounts. However, there is a limitation on this graph because it can only show information at a specific time and we can not see any trend on the graph.

In the third sheet, in order to recognise a trend in data, we mainly have focused on a line graph and diverging bar chart combined with an option of stateâ€™s checkboxes which will allow users to filter in/out by their interest.

The fourth sheet is relatively similar to the third but different aspects and has an extra timeline bar. This visualisation indicates overall information of both migration population and GDP on the same space. In this way, users can realise a correlation without difficulty.

The fifth sheet, our final idea is grouping three different visualisations on previous sheets and only has one controller section which enables users to adjust conditions and see a change of data on species of the time.
